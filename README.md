xchat2-monochrome-icons
=======================

Some xchat2 icons for a monochrome theme.


# Install
I use **Archlinux**, so if the path may differ in your distro, try to
figure it out.

Create `/usr/share/xchat` and copy `xchat.png` and `highlight.png`
into it. Then just restart XChat2 and you should be good to go.

Currently there are only 48x48px icons, and only one for the standard
XChat2 icon, and one for the highlight.
